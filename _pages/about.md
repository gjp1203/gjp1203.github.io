I am currently a research fellow in the University of Liverpool's <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/">Geographical Data Science Lab (GDSL)</a>. My research focuses on applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods toward solving public health problems. I completed my PhD at the University of Liverpool's computer science department under the supervision of <a href="http://www.karltuyls.net/">Prof. Karl Tuyls</a> and <a href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/"> Prof. Rahul Savani</a>. During my PhD I developed a number of approaches that enable independent learners to overcome multi-agent learning pathologies within fully-cooperative team-games, both in traditional settings and domains that necessitate a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach. In August 2020 I shall be commencing a PostDoc position with the 
<a href="https://www.l3s.de/en">L3S Research Center</a>, where I will be working on cutting edge machine learning challenges.
