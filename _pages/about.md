I am currently a research fellow in the University of Liverpool's <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/">Geographical Data Science Lab (GDSL)</a>. My current research focuses on applying state-of-the-art deep learning methods toward solving public health problems, e.g., the identification of unhealthy advertisements within street view images. Up until recently I was a PhD student at the University of Liverpool's computer science department under the supervision of <a href="http://www.karltuyls.net/">Prof. Karl Tuyls</a> and <a href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/"> Prof. Rahul Savani</a>. During my PhD I developed a number of approaches that enable independent learners to overcome multi-agent learning pathologies within fully-cooperative team-games, both in traditional settings and domains that necessitate a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach.

Research Interests
======

<h2>Automated Inspection of Pharmaceutical Drugs</h2>

One of the challenges faced within the pharmaceutical industry is screening injectable drugs to ensure that the liquid is free of aggregates and undesirable particles. Currently the screening is a manual task carried out by humans. However, the scale of this task raises the question whether deep learning techniques can be used to detect non-desirable particles. The objective is to implement an additional layer of screening to aid our project partner, the <a href='https://www.hal-allergy.com/' target='_blank'>Hal Allergy~Group</a>. 

<h2>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>

I am interested in the learning dynamics of decentralised Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) agents within fully cooperative, temporally extended and high dimensional domains, that require agents to overcome numerous pathologies in order to reach optimal joint-policies. Reinforcement learning literature contains numerous methods designed to overcome these pathologies. However, these methods are predominately evaluated using bimatrix games and fully observable Markov games consisting of a small number of probabilistic state transitions. This raises questions regarding whether algorithms that deliver strong performances in traditional settings scale to domains suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Implementations of MA-DRL algorithms and environments discussed in my research can be found in the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/gjp1203/nui_in_madrl" target="_blank">https://github.com/gjp1203/nui_in_madrl</a>.
