I am a PostDoc at the  <a href="https://www.l3s.de/en">L3S Research Center</a>, Leibmiz University Hannover, Germany. My research focus is on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), in particular the scalability of traditional MARL methods to deep-MARL. 

Previously I was a research fellow in the University of Liverpool's <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/">Geographical Data Science Lab (GDSL)</a>, where my research focused on applying state-of-the-art deep learning methods toward solving public health problems, e.g., the identification of unhealthy advertisements within street view images. 

I completed my PhD in 2019 at the University of Liverpool's computer science department under the supervision of <a href="http://www.karltuyls.net/">Prof. Karl Tuyls</a> and <a href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/"> Prof. Rahul Savani</a>. During my PhD I developed a number of approaches that enable independent learners to overcome multi-agent learning pathologies within fully-cooperative team-games, both in traditional settings and domains that necessitate a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach.
